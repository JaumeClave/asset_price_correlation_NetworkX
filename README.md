# Applying Network Analytics to Visualize ETF Asset Price Correlations
<div style="text-align: justify">“Diversify your portfolio!” Words everyone has heard and a portfolio managers priority. Diversifying methods vary from selecting different asset classes (funds, bonds, stocks, etc.), combining industries, or varying the risk levels of investments. And the most common and direct diversification measurement used in these methods is correlation. Correlation is how closely variables are related and it may be measured with Pearsons correlation coefficient, the degree of linear relationship between two variables. Its values range between -1 (perfect negative correlation) and 1 (perfect positive correlation). While a zero correlation implies no relationship between variables. True diversification is therefore only realistically achieved by investing in assets which are uncorrelated (0) with each other. This project uses NetworkX and nxviz to investigate and visualize these relationships and investigate price correlations for 39 different assets (currencies, commodities, equities and bonds) with the aim of showing an investor what assets they might need to hold to truly diversify their portfolio.</div>
